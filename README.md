## Introduction

Tabby Connection Gateway via [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) is a reimagined version of the [Tabby Connection Gateway](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby-connection-gateway), now leveraging the power of Google Cloud to efficiently route traffic. This gateway service enables Tabby Web to establish a wide range of network connections directly from a web browser.
